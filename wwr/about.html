            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Founded in 1998 by river enthusiast Mark Johnson, White Water Rafting Adventures began with a single raft
                and a passion for sharing the thrill of river running. What started as weekend trips for friends quickly
                grew into a full-time operation as word spread about our exceptional guides and commitment to safety.
                Over the past 25 years, we've introduced over 50,000 adventurers to the joy of white water rafting while
                maintaining our core values of safety first, environmental responsibility, and creating lifelong
                memories.</p>
